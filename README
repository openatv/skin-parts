Designing skinparts:
--------------------

For compatibility with
   * MetrixHD
   * other skins
please use the following structure:

(1) skinparts file for MetrixHD:
    skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME/SKINPARTS_NAME.xml
    - MetrixHD skinparts cannot define their own colors or fonts

(2) skinparts file for other skins with AtileHD support:
    allScreens/skin_SKINPARTS_NAME.xml
    - skinparts for other skins can define their own colors or fonts
    - please make sure not to re-define colors or fonts used in any skins

All bitmaps, icons, fonts etc. used by the skinpart should be put in
    skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME

Anything that is not required for running the skinpart (e.g. pdf documentation) should be put in
    otherData/SKINPARTS_NAME


Using skinparts:
----------------

for MetrixHD:

   * copy skinparts  to /usr/share/enigma2/MetrixHD/skinparts
   
   * use the MyMetrixLite plugin for enabling skinparts (skinpart settings)
   * see also https://www.opena.tv/skins/21609-metrixhd-selbsterstellte-skinpart.html#post192960
   
for other skins with AtileHD support (e.g. DMConcinnity-HD):

   * copy skinparts  to /usr/share/enigma2/SKIN_NAME/skinparts
   * copy allScreens to /usr/share/enigma2/SKIN_NAME/allScreens
   
   * in the "setup - SKIN_NAME" menu, activate "SKIN_NAME pro" and press yellow for enabling skinparts
