Designing skinparts:
--------------------

For compatibility with
   * MetrixHD
   * other skins
please use the following structure:

(1) skinparts file for MetrixHD:
    skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME/SKINPARTS_NAME.xml
    - MetrixHD skinparts cannot define their own colors or fonts
    for MetrixHD skinparts, a symbolic link must be created:
    MetrixHD/skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME -> ../../skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME

(2) skinparts file for other skins with AtileHD support:
    skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME/skin_SKINPARTS_NAME.xml
    - skinparts for other skins can define their own colors or fonts
    - please make sure not to re-define colors or fonts used in any skins
    symbolic links are created by AtileHD in the active skin folder:
    /usr/share/enigma2/SKIN_NAME/skinparts -> ../../skinparts
    /usr/share/enigma2/SKIN_NAME/allScreens/skin_SKINPARTS_NAME.xml -> ../../skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME/skin_SKINPARTS_NAME.xml

All bitmaps, icons, fonts etc. used by the skinpart should be put in
    skinparts/SKINPARTS_NAME

Anything that is not required for running the skinpart (e.g. pdf documentation) should be put in
    otherData/SKINPARTS_NAME
    
The genearted ipk file contains only the "skinparts" and "MetrixHD" folder and installs them as
    /usr/share/enigma2/skinparts
    /usr/share/enigma2/MetrixHD


Using skinparts:
